`Credits to ƒêuvent for making both the lore of the factions and the two attack maps`

`Genesux`: In the "Siravax System" they lay in the sub-zero temperature planet  called "Siratla", other planets in the system that are comrpised of Siratla Stone and Crystals are Ruxt, While Vantax is a Gas Planet, these three specific planets also have multiple satelites(moons) surrounding them, the star is Siravax and the Genesux are comprised of Stone and Siratla, They are golem-like beings and are strong, their weapons and creations are made out of metal material from outer-space they get from their massive invasions, and they use tons and tons of energy and electricity, they are nicknamed "Astronomical Trophy".

`Solran`: These Creatures are almost an Opposition of the Genesux since they are extremely hot/molten and have capabilities out of this galaxy, they are found in the "Alphandax System", which is an astronomical question, since this is a Binary System with Alphandax and Betanax, but there are planets orbiting, anyways moving on we have these creatures, they are comprised of molten rock and material they get from under the volcanos, they get titanium and multiple igna-rocks and they fuse them together to get a strong material that they use to form their absolute monsters, other satelites/planets in this Binary System include, Furnius and Siten.

`Elecian`: They are found in the "Vanstarius System", they live on a gassy planet with 3/4 satelites, other planets in this system also have satelites, the other planets are, Ravu, Duris. Mineus, although Duris and Mineus dont have satelites we will still include them, the Eleciams are monsters at destruction and show no mercy, their technology are very advanced and are un-matched by the other Electric Giant, Genesux, they are very strong and can pack quite a punch, wether you have walls or not, the material that they use are unkown and are probably an alloy made out of titanium and some other material.

`Purtuxe`: in the deep deep Bootes Void there lies a system called "Mormon System", Astronomeers from Serpulo call it the "Primordial System", this species lives in "Xeantra", with satelites/planets surrounding it such as Xetrius and Celtus, They are powered by Pure Dark Energy and emit a purple aura, they use their strong and hard materials to create weapons and their supposed "Octopi-Creations", they are also quite amphibious and cannot drown, except for early creations which are weak.

`Quantra`: These Aquatic Creatures are found in the "Lumian System", they arent observed as much as the others but have developed underwater and on islands and shores, they live in an radioactive biome of an ocean, they somehow get their materials to make several naval weapons, they will also invent other weapons that devastate everything.
